        - bugfix: mysql unique constraint code had an
          obvious but longstanding error
        - bugfix: columns were being specified out-of-order,
          bug was introduced in the 0.03004 column metadata
          dumping feature
        - dump code now skips+warns instead of dies when
          dump_overwrite not set

        - loader_options can now be embedded in the connection info
        - Documentation improvements

          warnings (most did before).
        - Somewhat improved test coverage

0.03003  Tue Jun  6 02:22:49 UTC 2006
        - Fix inclusion of external add-on class definitions
          in dump_to_dir output.

0.03002  Tue Jun  6 01:27:25 UTC 2006
        - rethrow exceptions that occur during make_schema_at

0.03001  Mon Jun  5 23:17:57 UTC 2006

          the generic methods happen to work for that vendor.
        - New tests for the various current and legacy/deprecated
          methods of connecting a Schema::Loader class/object.

0.02999_03  Mon Mar 13 15:01:11 UTC 2006
        - Added EXAMPLE section to pod [Kieren Diment]
        - Invasive heavy changes to the DBI- and vendor-specific code
          (expect some breakage in some cases until this settles down)
        - Support for loading UNIQUE constraints
        - Tests cleaned up a bit
        - Relationship building seperated out into it's own file for
          the changes that are coming, but still does basically what
          it did before (this work is the next step).

0.02999_02  Sat Mar  4 16:53:21 UTC 2006
        - Merged in relevant changes from trunk since the split

0.02005  Mon Feb 27 23:53:17 UTC 2006

0.02002  Sat Feb 18 19:53:12 UTC 2006
        - Added moniker_map and inflect_map

0.02001  Fri Feb 17 20:25:40 UTC 2006
        - tests fixed up a bit
        - auto-loading of on-disk class definitions layered on top

        - new parameters components and resultset_components, which do
          the obvious for the generated table classes.
        - DBIx::Class pre-req bumped to 0.05006, since Schema::Loader
          is virtually gauranteed to cause subtle mod_perl problems
          without those fixes.

        - Just docs/version update, 0.01004 code released as 0.02000
